#Link to the video that'll show just how bad it looks, ignore the bad art sincee immm slowwlyy working on it; I want to get the actual game working before making it pretty:

So i've been trying to do this background sidescroller for a while and I just can't get it working the way I want.
This is the code right now:

var skySpeed = 1000
var speedMountain = 150
var speedHills = 320
var speedPlains = 400

func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	var cameraX = $"../CharacterBody2D/Camera2D".global_position.x
	sky.global_position.x = $"../CharacterBody2D/Camera2D".global_position.x
	mountain.global_position.x = move_toward(mountain.global_position.x,cameraX,delta * speedMountain)
	plains.global_position.x = move_toward(mountain.global_position.x,cameraX,delta * speedPlains)

It should slightly follow the camera when the player is moving to create this immersive dynamic, but I cant quite remember a game that does it like this. I dont remember...I think Hollow Knight did?
Anyway, it looks really snappy and sloppy and I cant get it looking right...and Id like to avoid just making another generic parallax scroller. Can anyone lend a hand?
